  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) can be reliably used as a measure to monitor the functionality of the cardiovascular system. Recently, there has been a great attention towards accurate categorization of heartbeats. While there are many commonalities between different ECG conditions, the focus of most studies has been classifying a set of conditions on a dataset annotated for that task rather than learning and employing a transferable knowledge between different tasks. In this paper, we propose a method based on deep convolutional neural networks for the classification of heartbeats which is able to accurately classify five different arrhythmias in accordance with the AAMI EC57 standard. Furthermore, we suggest a method for transferring the knowledge acquired on this task to the myocardial infarction (MI) classification task. We evaluated the proposed method on PhysionNet's MIT-BIH and PTB Diagnostics datasets. According to the results, the suggested method is able to make predictions with the average accuracies of 93.4\% and 95.9\% on arrhythmia classification and MI classification, respectively.},

  abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning. Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10\,seconds length. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.,  Measurement(s)electrocardiography â€¢ cardiovascular systemTechnology Type(s)12 lead electrocardiographyFactor Type(s)presence of co-occurring diseasesSample Characteristic - OrganismHomo sapiens , Machine-accessible metadata file describing the reported data: 10.6084/m9.figshare.12098055},
